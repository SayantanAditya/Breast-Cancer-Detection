# Breast-Cancer-Detection
In this project, I used three different classification algorithms and compared their results. I tested the results of a logistic regression model, a decision tree classifier, and a random forest classifier on classifying tumors as either benign or malignant.
About 1 in 8 women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of their lifetime. And every year, over 90,000 women in India alone, will die from breast cancer.

But what’s even more shocking is that the most significant risk factors for breast cancer are gender (being a woman) and age (growing older). Most breast cancer is found in women who do not have symptoms.

Women cannot prevent or control their risk for breast cancer, nor is it often diagnosed quickly because of the lack of symptoms and abnormalities they face.

By leveraging machine learning, we can reduce the number of women who are diagnosed with and die from breast cancer. Machine learning allows us to detect the presence of tumors quicker, thus improving the patient’s chances of survival.

In this project, I built a machine learning model that can classify a tumor as either benign, meaning that the tumor is not harmful, or malignant, a type of destructive tumor that can grow rapidly and proposes a serious threat to the patient.
